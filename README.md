# Learning ReactJS

I will learn ReactJS through online resources, and this is where I will take notes on the topics.

# Project 1

## Making a Static Webpage

- We will first pull in ReactDoms through CDN and Babble to start coding.
- Importing the script tags give us global access to ReactDom in `index.js`
  - First is what do I render, second is where do I render it
  - We make a `div` with an id of `"root"`, and call `document.getElementById("root")` to get it
  - Really annoying, you need to run it on your own server to be able to display it, so you need `python -m http.server 8800` to make the server, and then go to `localhost:8800`
